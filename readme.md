`primary.py` uses the requests module to scrape US presidential candidates' names from 
news and politics sites listed in `news_sites.txt` against names in `names.txt`. The 
data is automatically saved to a json-encoded file as 'data_'+current date/time. 

`primary2.py` offers to open a selection of the available data and displays the selected data as a 
mini ascii spreadsheet.
